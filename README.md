The MainActivity is our main view wich uses the JoystickView of joystick object.
*Special feature:*
1. Each time the joystick is freed after finger touch it turns back to its initial location - in the center of the screen.
2. In the JoystickApp we're using a logger named Timber. If the user enters a wrong input in the ip address field or in the port field we'll know the exact error.
